        <h2>5. Simulation State Viewer</h2>
        <p>
            The simulation window is only visible during a simulation. 
            It displays the information of all declared registers, busses, 
            memories and register arrays and the current state and cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            On top of the table it contains the current state and cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            The table displays the current entries of all declared components. 
            A change of an entry is highlighted in 
            <span class="yellowtext">yellow</span>. By double-clicking a 
            table cell that displays an entry it becomes editable an a new 
            entry can be entered. To apply the changes use the enter key. 
            To discard them use the escape key.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each declared memory displays a button that opens the window where 
            the content of the corresponding memory is shown and editable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each declared register array has this button as well to manage 
            its contents.
