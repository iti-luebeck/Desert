        <h2>8. Breakpoint Viewer</h2>
        <p>This window shows all breakpoints where the simulation will stop.</p>
        <p>
            A Breakpoint marks the state at which the simulation stops if it
            runs. Breakpoints are added via a click on the corresponding 
            line number in the <a href="editor.html">Editor Window</a> or via 
            the context menu of the <a href="editor.html">Editor Window</a>.
            They can be deleted from within the 
            Breakpoint Viewer using the Delete Breakpoint Button, the context 
            menu of the <a href="editor.html">Editor Window</a> and by 
            clicking next to the marked line in the 
            <a href="editor.html">Editor Window</a>.
        </p>
