            A Breakpoint marks the state at which the simulation stops if it runs.
            Breakpoints are added via a click on the corresponding line number in the <a href="editor.html">Editor Window</a> or via the context menu of the <a href="editor.html">Editor Window</a>.
            They can be deleted from within the <a href="breakpoint-viewer.html">Breakpoint Viewer</a>, the context menu of the <a href="editor.html">Editor Window</a> and by clicking next to the marked line.
